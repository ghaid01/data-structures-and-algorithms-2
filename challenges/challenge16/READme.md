# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
did a binary tree and wrote a test for the inorder method
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
we should create a node class and a binary tree class with a method i used inOrder() and tried to do an if statement to see wether the node is divisible by 3 or 5 or either or niether 
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach?-->
created classes with one tree method created a binary tree and did one test
